# RÃ©sultat de la revue

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am unable to analyze the code you provided. However, here's a suggestion for improvement: instead of assigning the sum of `a` and `b` to the function `add`, try using the `return` statement directly on the addition operation itself like this:

```python
def add(a, b):
    # return the sum of a and b
    return a + b
print(add(2, "3"))
``` 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
